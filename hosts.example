# The `hosts` inventory file lists the JupyterHub servers managed by Ansible

# This provides an inventory of host servers used for JupyterHub
# Edit the fqdn (fully qualified domain name) for your hub server
# For example:
#
# [jupyterhub_hosts]
# www.example.com
#
# Save file as `hosts` (without the file type suffix) when done editing.
# User tip: `hosts.example` is an example file where the contents are
# ignored. Saving the file as `hosts` after editing is important.
